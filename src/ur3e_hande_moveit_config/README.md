## ur3e_hande_moveit_config

This package defines configuration parameters of the combined robotic system of hand-e gripper and ur3e robot arm. 
Included files are autogenerated through the "MoveIt Setup Assistant" program and modified according to the need afterwards. 

/srdf/ur.srdf is the key file that was generated through the "MoveIt Setup Assistant" program. It defines the collision matrix for the custom robot+arm configuration.
The input the "MoveIt Setup Assistant" program is a .urdf file that combines both the design files for the ur3e robot arm and the hande gripper. 
Generating the .urdf file is described below:

In this case, the combined .xacro file is named as ur.urdf.xacro. **In our current setup, this file is /ur3e_hande_robot_description/urdf/ur_with_hande.xacro.**

We use the ur.urdf.xacro file to generate the ur.urdf file using the following command, **(make sure to correct the package names, and file names to the appropriate names/locations of your workspace.)**
```bash
ros2 run xacro xacro $(ros2 pkg prefix ur3e_hande_description)/share/ur3e_hande_description/urdf/ur.urdf.xacro name:=ur ur_type:=ur3e joint_limit_params:=$(ros2 pkg prefix ur3e_hande_description)/share/ur3e_hande_description/config/ur3e/joint_limits.yaml kinematics_params:=$(ros2 pkg prefix ur3e_hande_description)/share/ur3e_hande_description/config/ur3e/default_kinematics.yaml physical_params:=$(ros2 pkg prefix ur3e_hande_description)/share/ur3e_hande_description/config/ur3e/physical_parameters.yaml visual_params:=$(ros2 pkg prefix ur3e_hande_description)/share/ur3e_hande_description/config/ur3e/visual_parameters.yaml > ur.urdf
```

Next, follow [this useful link on using MoveIt Setup Assistant](https://gramaziokohler.github.io/compas_fab/0.16.0/examples/03_backends_ros/08_ros_create_moveit_package_from_custom_urdf.html) to generate the ur.srdf file. This process will end up generating other useful files such as /rviz/view_robot.rviz
